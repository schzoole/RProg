## This file uses memoization (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization)
## to implement a cached version of a funciton to compute matrix inversion.
## If the input matrix has not changed since the last time the inverse was 
## calculated, we do not recompute the inverse and instead return the cached
## version.  If the matrix does change, we will recompute the inverse.

## makeCacheMatrix(matrix)
## wrapper around a standard R matrix, proving getter and setter methods,
## and getinverse and setinverse methods to store a cached version of the 
## inverse.  If the underlying matrix is changed via its setter, the cached
## inverse is invalidated

makeCacheMatrix <- function(m = matrix()) 
{
    inverse <- NULL # inverse starts uncomputed
    
    ## set(matrix)
    ## sets the underlying matrix and invalidates the cached inverse
    set <- function(y) 
    {
        m <<- y
        inverse <<- NULL
    }
    
    ## get()
    ## return the underlying matrix
    get <- function()
    {
        m
    }
    
    ## setinverse(matrix)
    ## sets (but does not compute!) the value of the inverse of the underlying
    ## matrix
    setinverse <- function(inv) 
    {
        inverse <<- inv
    }
    
    ## return the cached value of the inverse of the matrix.
    ## returns NULL if the inverse has not yet be set, or the underlying
    ##   matrix has changed since the last invocation
    getinverse <- function() 
    {
        inverse
    }
    
    ## return a list of getter and setter methods as a result of object creation
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setinverse = setinverse,
         getinverse = getinverse)    
}


## cacheSolve(cacheMatrix, ...)
## Returns the inverse of the passed in cacheMatrix object
## If the inverse has already been calculated and the matrix not changed
## since the last invocation, returns the cached version.
## If the inverse has not yet been calculated or the underlying matrix 
## changed since the last call, (re)computes the value with a call to solve(...)

cacheSolve <- function(m, ...) {
    ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'm'
    inv <- m$getinverse()
    if(!is.null(inv)) 
    {
        ## Inverse already calculated, value not stale
        message("getting cached data")
        return(inv)
    }
    
    ## Either inverse has never been calculated or cached inverse is stale
    data <- m$get()
    inv <- solve(data, ...)
    m$setinverse(inv)
    inv    
}

## Test function to exercise above code.  Would be better written as a unit test
## using RUnit.
## A matrix multiplied by it's inverse will equal the identity matrix.
## 
## for a 2x2 matrix this will look like
## getting cached data
##       [,1] [,2]
## [1,]    1    0
## [2,]    0    1
